I'm currently a software engineer at [Retool](https://retool.com/) - a low code platform for internal tools.

Before Retool, I was a software engineer at Airkit - a low code platform for customer experience.

The common thread here is that I love working with programming languages - something I discovered during my undergrad at UCLA.
